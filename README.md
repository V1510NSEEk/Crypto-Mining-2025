## 🧠 What Is Crypto Mining?

Mining is the process of validating transactions on a blockchain network using computational power. Miners solve cryptographic puzzles to add blocks to the chain and earn crypto rewards.

### Types of Mining:
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** – Requires mining hardware (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin)
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** – No mining; involves staking coins (e.g., Ethereum post-merge)

## 💡 What Can You Still Mine in 2025?

| Coin        | Notes                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Bitcoin** | Requires ASIC hardware              |
| **Litecoin**| Scrypt-based, moderate competition  |
| **Monero**  | CPU mineable, privacy-focused       |
| **Dogecoin**| Merge-mined with LTC                |
| **Kaspa**   | GPU-friendly                        |
| **Ravencoin**| Also GPU mineable                  |

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

| Coin         | Best Hardware                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Bitcoin      | ASIC Miner (e.g., Antminer S19 XP) |
| Litecoin/DOGE| ASIC or GPU                         |
| Monero       | High-performance CPU (Ryzen/i9)    |
| KAS / RVN    | Mid-high GPU (RTX 3060+, RX 6700)  |

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup (Monero CPU Mining Example)

### 1. Create a Wallet
- [Download Monero GUI Wallet](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/)
- Save your recovery phrase and keys securely

### 2. Download Mining Software
- [XMRig GitHub Repo](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)
- Extract and configure `config.json`

### 3. Join a Mining Pool
- Recommended: [supportxmr.com](https://supportxmr.com)
- Get pool address and port (e.g., `pool.supportxmr.com:5555`)

### 4. Run the Miner
```bash
./xmrig -o pool.supportxmr.com:5555 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x
```

### 5. Monitor Progress
- Your terminal shows hashrate
- Use pool dashboard to monitor earnings

## 🔒 Safety Tips

- ❌ Never download miners from shady sites
- ✅ Use a dedicated or virtual machine
- ⚡ Check your local electricity rates
- 🔥 Watch for overheating and power consumption
- 📜 Research local laws and tax regulations

## 📉 Profitability Reminder
Mining in 2025 is not easy money:
- High electricity costs
- Specialized hardware needed
- Solo mining is rarely profitable

Use this guide to learn, experiment, or build a hobby setup!

## 🧪 Bonus: Simulate Mining

Use testnets or simulation tools:
- [Kadena Testnet](https://docs.kadena.io/)
- [Ethereum Sepolia Testnet](https://sepolia.dev/)
